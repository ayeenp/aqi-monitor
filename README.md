# aqi-monitor
Air Quality Index monitor is a simple GNOME Shell extension that displays the Air Quality Index (AQI) of your city in the GNOME toolbar. It fetches AQI data from two different APIs, updates the data peridically, and shows the current AQI value. The extension uses a Python script to retrieve the AQI data and store it in a temporary file, which is then read by the GNOME Shell extension to display the AQI value.
